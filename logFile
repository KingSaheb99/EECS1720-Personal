Decided to start a new project. I'm imagining my own take on a physics engine in Processing. Right now I'm just gonna aim for a ball that jumps in the direction of the
mouse with selectable forces when clicked/held. Will work off of this after it's completed.

13/01/22:
Worked some more on the "Force SImulator". Upgraded the bal to its own class and moved related code over. 
Saved as a branch to the original. Will merge after some more progress is made.

14/01/22:
Created this repo and read through some things on the p5.js reference to see what I could add to the examplke from Thursday's class.

15/01/22:
Moved the class repo conent over to here. Looked through the code to try and get a better handle on JS

16/01/22:
Uploaded the changes to the example from Lecture 2. Made the ball change colours every second. constrained its x and y positions to the edges of the canvas, 
replaced some hard values with named variables to increases readability, tested the default ellipse setting.

18/01/22:
Watched some videos on browser extensions in prep for lab.

19/01/22:
Worked on getting the extensions to work in both Chrome and FireFox for the lab. Stayed after class to get the YorkU file share working. Was unsuccesful. 
TA said to contact York IT.
